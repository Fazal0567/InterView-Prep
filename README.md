## 🔒 Environment Variables (.env)

Both the backend and frontend may require their own `.env` files to manage environment-specific settings such as API keys, database URLs, and secret tokens.

### Example `.env` structure for `backend/.env`:
```
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### Example `.env` structure for `frontend/.env`:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

**Note:**  
- Never commit your real `.env` files to the repository, as they may contain sensitive information.
- Always refer to `.env.example` (if provided) for the necessary environment variables.
